# Intel Chipsim

The goal of this project is to to simulate legacy Intel CPUs like the intel 8008, intel 8080, or intel 8086. The current focus is the intel 8008, where the implementation is still underway. Information regarding the intel 8008's operation can be found under [i8008.md](i8008.md).

Beware, currently the package runs a cumbersome interactive shell. The end goal is to abstract that away and eventually come up with an asyncronous way to load a program into memory, start up the chip, and watch it process.
